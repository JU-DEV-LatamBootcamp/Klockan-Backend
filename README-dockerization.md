# Backend with Docker Containers

## Setting up the Backend API and Database in a Container:

Follow these steps to set up the API and Database using Docker:

### 1. Navigate to the Work Directory:
   
   Change your working directory to the location where you want to set up the API.
   
### 2. Build the Container:
   
   Execute the following command to build and start the container:
   
   ```
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```
   
   This command will build the container and run it in detached mode (`-d`), allowing it to operate in the background.
   
   ***Note:*** Ensure that you have a valid `docker-compose.yml` file in your work directory.
   
### 3. Run the Container (Without Building):
   
   If you've already built the container and want to start it without rebuilding, use the following command:
   
   ```
   docker run klockan-backend
   ```
   
### 4. Stop the Container:
 
   To stop the running Keycloak container, use the following command:
   
   ```
   docker stop klockan-backend
   ```
   
### 5. Remove the Container:
    
   If you want to remove the Keycloak container and associated volumes, execute the following command:
   
   ```
   docker-compose down -v
   ```
